Weather Sprint
Using multiple api's I created a Weather app that allows you to search for cities and also bookmark them.

Peer Review Comments: Very nice design and show the weather information in a very useful way; it shows the work in a very creative way; i like the graph of showing the temp for the coming days. Things i wish included are when you write the city name you don't need to click the search button but press Enter key instead and the name of the city will be deleted after that. Over all a very good and creative work.
